Panic can be a great motivator as stock prices go up or down. But how are you going to handle that? Most individual traders would rather look for steady, reliable commodities like government bonds, mutual funds, or bonds that are trending in one direction like an index funds. While it is important to pay attention to where the market is going, you could do much better putting your money in low risk investments and letting the profits stream in on a continuous basis for many years. But how are you going to find that? It used to be that only large institutions like pension funds and mutual funds had the time and resources to perform the due diligence that it takes today because ordinary people like you and me can open a stockbrokerage account easily and with no startup fees. But even that is no longer the case.

The internet has opened up door after door of options for individual investors to start their own brokerage. It is now entirely possible for anyone with an initial investment of $1,000 or $10,000 to buy and sell stocks over the internet in the privacy of their own home, or a small office of their own, without having to worry about building a brand name for themselves.

But there are many risks involved.

So what should you look for?

Here are some tips that will give you a good idea of whether a stock is risky or not:

Many investor groups and online trading services encourage the purchase of stocks based on the performance of a small group of stocks. The following will be an excellent place to evaluate whether there is any value to this strategy:

a. How do the stocks cash-flow their cash? Before you invest in a particular stock, make sure that it has cash-flow with plenty of liquidity. The idea is to only purchase stocks that have at least two times the current earnings of their nearest competitors.

b. Look at the market value of the equity. Does it vary much from the quoted price or are the prices generally in lock-step with each other? If the prices vary from fair value or market value, it is probably cheaper for that company to get credit from a bank or finance company.

c. Check the financials of the equity. Do they have a profit that is bigger than the industry average? Are the financials stable?

d. Does the company have a product-based business or is it a service-oriented company? It is easier to make money in a service-oriented industry than in a product-based business.

The answer to all of the questions listed herein is straightforward NO. The stock is safe assuming it meets or exceeds its intrinsic value and the opportunity cost of acquiring additional equity.

The company is sound, stable and has an asset/equity ratio of at least one. The situation for the company is comfortable, mature and not so much in turmoil. They are probably not in dire need of any additional equity.

An out-and-out money lender is not going to make money investing in a company that is at least nine years old.
